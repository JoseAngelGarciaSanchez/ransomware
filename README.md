# Ransomware : Encrypting files

<br>

## About the Project
Creating a ransomware from scratch to understand better how a ransomware works. It is based on cryptography librairy with Fernet encryptation. Fernet is a symmetric encryption method which makes sure that the message encrypted cannot be manipulated/read without the key. It uses URL safe encoding for the keys. Fernet also uses 128-bits AES.

In this repository, you will find the following elements:
* Three text files for testing the ransomware : file.txt, file2.txt, pleasedonthurtme.txt
* The ransomware :bug: : Voldermort.py
* The decrypt script : decrypt.py

<!-- Console Application -->
## Console Application:
The first part is the console version of the final application, our "beta-application" if you want. This version of the application takes into account two arguments : the data as a csv file, and the keyword that serves as your research (for example, Louvre, Op√©ra, or even Picasso) to let the recommendation system find the most similar events to suggest to the user.

### Installation and launching the ransomware:

1. Clone the repository
```sh
https://github.com/Pse1234/ransomware.git
```
2. Change your current working directory
```sh
cd ransomware
```
3. Install required dependencies
```sh
source install.sh
```
3. Launch the application
```sh
python voldemort.py
```
